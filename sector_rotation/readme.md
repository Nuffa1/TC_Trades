* Credit conditions (spreads, lending standards)

### **Sector-Regime Mapping**

Each regime has sectors that tend to outperform 

### **Asset-Level Confirmation**

Signals applied after regime detection:

* Momentum
* Volatility
* Relative strength

### **Portfolio Construction**

##  Goals

* **Detect macro regime** using a composite of economic indicators.
* **Map regimes to sectors** based on historical performance.
* **Use asset-level filters** to confirm sector strength.
* **Build a diversified portfolio** aligned with the current regime.
* **Backtest the full pipeline** with realistic execution assumptions.
* **Automate data → regime → sector → portfolio workflow.**
