// Definitions

Sector rotation strategy that shifts investment capital among different sectors of the market(tech,energy,finance) based on expectations about each sector.

Sectors are standardized groups of companies with similar business activities. Examples:

Technology

Industrials

Materials

Utilities

Financials

Consumer Discretionary

Consumer Staples

Healthcare

A signal is any measurable input used to rank or score sectors.
Common signal categories:

Price-based (momentum, trend strength, volatility)

Macro-based (interest rates, PMI, inflation)

Fundamental (earnings revisions, valuation ratios)

Risk-based (correlation, drawdown)

The program will combine signals -> produce a score -> rank sectors.

A statistical / algorithmic model that produces a ranking for all sectors based on your signals.

Example:

Score = 0.4 * Momentum + 0.3 * Volatility + 0.3 * MacroStrength


The model’s output determines which sectors you invest in.

Once sectors are ranked, you need rules for:

How many sectors to hold

Weighting (equal weight, score-weighted, risk-parity)

Rebalancing frequency (weekly, monthly, quarterly)

A historical simulation that tests how your sector-rotation strategy would have performed.
Key components:

Transaction costs

Slippage

Rebalancing rules

Out-of-sample validation

Robustness tests (e.g., noise injection, walk-forward analysis)
